# Color constant generator
This utils a small formula to generate color fades constant with a base color constant.
It allows HSL, RBG, HEX and String colors in the input.

All modifications are based on HSL calculations, where Hue will be the same base color HUE + the Hue value from below.

Saturation and Lightness would be a percent of the base color Saturation and Lightness.

Enjoy!
